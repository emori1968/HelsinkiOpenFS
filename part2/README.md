***comments***

All exercises was commited before going to next exercise step. <br>
Phonebook project continuous in [Part 3](https://github.com/emori1968/FullStackPart3) it can be run from the fullstack dist <br>
Optional exercises 2.18~2.20 were done after Part3 completion. <br>
Project "countries" interact with REST APIs getting countries information, weather conditions and images.
From my point of view [source info](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/) has wrong/controversial information.
