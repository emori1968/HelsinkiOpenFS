##  Full stack open course
### A [Tutorial](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) from Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki.

This is a  good guide to learn web, the course is based on a single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

**This repository contain the exercises of the course and its progress**
I commited each exercises steps (no branch) in order to keep a reference for future lecture of the course.

It is organized in folders were each folder contains projects from each Chapter of the course.

- Part1 contain projects ***courseinfo, unicafe, anecdotes*** from Chapter1 
- Part2 contain projects ***countries, phonebook*** from Chapter2
...

Since some projects continuous in the following Chapters you have to see the commit message to find the code of each exercise.
ex *phonebook* continuous in Part3, last commits is the last exersice step.

Chapter3 [Part3](https://github.com/emori1968/FullStackPart3) is at a different repository cause it host a fullstack app deployed in the web with *Render* (a Render host requirement)

#### *commets*

Through this course I'm finding that JavaScript is a complete different language from other I know (C, Python, R)

Since my knowledge background was built related to manufacturing process I found JS more likely a PLC ladders than a traditional programming code.<br>
JS was hard and unpredicteble at first, not eassy to see the bullet coming!<br>
Anyway I'm enjoining this course, It is exciting when thinks works!

#### Thank you very much for those how prepare this material.

#### **Gracias**
